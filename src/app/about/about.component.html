          <p class=" mb-4">I was born as a regular human being but aware of the immense potential within me.
            My areas of interest comprehends Human Personality, Individual Discovery and Self Expression Postive Communication, Coping Strategies to deal with Anxiety and Unworthiness and Couple interaction and progression on a daily basis and in particular delicate phases of their journey together.
            It's my purpose to sustain you in your individualization process.
            Since I was little I was fascinated by people personalities, issues, and concerns and It's what it leads on my psychological path and the unconscious. The part the mystic tradition refers as the Soul. I possess a real treasure I would like to share with you-the ability to understand people in deep, Body, Mind, and Essence thanks to my further passion for Jung'life and Transpersonal Psychological approach (Body, Mind and Core Self. Combined in a well-being circle) My way of interacting and working with clients is rare, personal and tailored case by case.
            Together we can achieve Your Best.
